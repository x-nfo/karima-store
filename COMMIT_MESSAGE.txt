feat: Add comprehensive security unit tests based on SECURITY_TESTING_PLAN.md

This commit implements a complete suite of security unit tests covering:

- Authentication & Authorization (Ory Kratos middleware tests)
- Input Validation & Sanitization (SQL injection, XSS, command injection prevention)
- Rate Limiting (Redis-backed rate limiting with environment-specific limits)
- CORS Configuration (security headers, preflight handling, misconfiguration prevention)
- File Upload Security (magic bytes validation, extension spoofing prevention, size limits)
- Error Handling & Security Headers (sanitized error messages, consistent formatting)
- Product Service Security (SQL injection prevention, input validation, cache invalidation)
- Media Service Security (file validation, malicious file detection, upload security)

Test files created:
- internal/middleware/kratos_test.go
- internal/middleware/rate_limit_test.go
- internal/middleware/cors_test.go
- internal/middleware/validator_test.go
- internal/services/product_service_test.go
- internal/services/media_service_test.go
- internal/utils/response_test.go

Test setup files:
- internal/config/test_config.go
- internal/test_setup.go
- Makefile.test

All tests follow the security testing plan and include:
- Unit testing with mocking (testify/mock)
- Security attack vector testing (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF)
- Boundary testing and edge cases
- Error handling and information disclosure prevention
- Authentication and authorization validation

Coverage targets:
- Authentication middleware: 100%
- Input validation: 95%+
- Rate limiting: 90%+
- CORS: 100%
- Error handling: 90%+
- File security: 85%+
